# ACTIVE CONTEXT: PLAN MODE (Level 4)

## CURRENT MODE
**Mode:** PLAN (Level 4 - Complex System)
**Status:** Active
**Phase:** Planning Complete, Ready for Creative Phases

## CURRENT FOCUS
- Complete architectural planning and documentation
- Prepare for creative phases (UI/UX, Architecture, Data Model)
- Validate technology stack and dependencies
- Transition to CREATIVE mode for design work

## NEXT STEPS
1. **Creative Phase 1:** UI/UX Design
   - Onboarding flow design
   - Check-in interface design
   - Card interaction design
   - Badge and paywall design
   - CMS interface design

2. **Creative Phase 2:** Architecture Design
   - System architecture diagrams
   - Data flow and security architecture
   - Internationalization architecture
   - Integration architecture

3. **Creative Phase 3:** Data Model Design
   - Card JSON structure
   - User data model
   - Badge and payment models
   - Encrypted data handling

## STAKEHOLDERS & ROLES
- **Product Owner:** Vision, requirements, priorities, business goals
- **Psychology Team:** Card content, therapeutic approach, user needs
- **Development Team:** Architecture, implementation, testing, technical decisions
- **Support Team:** User feedback, onboarding assistance, content management
- **Users:** Feedback, usage patterns, satisfaction, feature requests

## PROJECT CONTEXT
- **Project:** Menhausen Telegram Mini App
- **Level:** 4 (Complex System)
- **Current Phase:** Planning Complete
- **Next Phase:** Creative Design
- **MVP Scope:** Onboarding, check-ins, cards, i18n, encryption

## TECHNICAL CONTEXT
- **Framework:** Next.js, React 18+, Vite, Tailwind CSS v4
- **Backend:** Firebase (Firestore, Functions, Hosting)
- **Integrations:** Telegram WebApp SDK, Payments API
- **Security:** Client-side AES-256-GCM encryption
- **Internationalization:** i18n with auto-detection

## DECISION POINTS
- **Card Storage:** JSON in repo vs Firebase Storage vs CDN (TBD in creative phase)
- **Offline Strategy:** Local cache vs service worker (future phase)
- **Web3 Integration:** TON wallet integration scope (future phase)
- **CMS Architecture:** Visual editor vs JSON-based approach

## RISKS & MITIGATIONS
- **Multi-language complexity:** Use i18n framework, automate translation workflow
- **Encryption UX:** Ensure encryption doesn't break user experience
- **Telegram SDK limitations:** Test across all Telegram clients
- **Payment edge cases:** Handle failures, retries, support flows
- **Phased rollout:** Ensure each phase is independently testable

## SUCCESS CRITERIA
- Memory Bank fully aligned and up-to-date
- Creative phases completed with comprehensive design
- Technology validation successful
- Ready for Phase 1 implementation
