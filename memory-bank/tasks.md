## Implementation Approach

### Development Principles
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Progressive enhancement for Telegram Mini App constraints
- Client-side encryption for sensitive user data
- Component-based architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Internationalization support from the start

### Code Quality Standards
- TypeScript for type safety
- Comprehensive test coverage (unit, integration)
- ESLint and Prettier for code formatting
- Regular code reviews
- Documentation for all components and services

## Dependencies
- Telegram WebApp SDK
- Firebase (Firestore, Functions, Hosting)
- Netlify (or alternative for Mini App)
- i18n library (e.g., react-i18next)
- AES-256-GCM crypto library (e.g., CryptoJS)
- Charting library (for mood graph)
- Telegram Payments API

## Challenges & Mitigations
- **Multi-language content management**: Use i18n with translation files, automate card translation workflow.
- **Encryption key management**: Store key only in browser/WebView, never transmit to server.
- **Offline/online sync**: Use local cache with sync queue, clear user feedback on sync status.
- **Telegram SDK quirks**: Test on multiple Telegram clients (iOS, Android, Desktop, Web).
- **Payment edge cases**: Handle payment failures, retries, and user support flows.
- **Phased rollout**: Ensure each phase is independently testable and does not block core flows.

## Testing Strategy
- Unit and integration tests for all flows
- Manual and automated UI tests (multi-language, device matrix)
- Security tests for encryption and data privacy
- Payment and badge logic tests
- Offline/online sync tests

## Documentation Plan
- Update Memory Bank docs at each phase
- API and architecture documentation
- User and admin guides
