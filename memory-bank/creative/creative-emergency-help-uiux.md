## 4Ô∏è‚É£ DECISION

**Selected Approach: Option A - Horizontal Card Slider**

**Justification:**
This approach leverages the existing EmergencySlider component while enhancing its design and functionality. The horizontal card layout provides immediate visibility of available techniques while maintaining a compact footprint on the main screen. The draggable interaction is intuitive and works well for both touch and mouse users. This approach also aligns with the existing design patterns seen in the imported Figma components and maintains consistency with the mood tracking interface.

**Key Design Elements:**
- Horizontal slider of technique cards
- Clear visual distinction for the emergency section
- Draggable interaction with smooth animations
- Tap to expand card details
- Visual indicators for additional cards

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES

### Visual Design
- Use calming colors (blues and greens) for the emergency section
- Implement subtle shadows and rounded corners for cards
- Use clear, readable typography (17px minimum for card titles)
- Add visual indicators for draggable area
- Include scroll indicators when applicable

### Interaction Design
- Horizontal drag/swipe to navigate between cards
- Tap to select and expand card details
- Smooth scrolling with momentum
- Visual feedback during drag interactions
- Clear affordances for draggable elements

### Technical Considerations
- Extend the existing EmergencySlider component
- Implement responsive card sizing
- Optimize for performance during drag interactions
- Ensure accessibility with keyboard navigation
- Add proper touch targets for mobile users

### Content Structure
1. **Section Header**
   - Clear heading: "Emergency Help"
   - Brief description: "Techniques to help when you're feeling overwhelmed"
   - Visual separator from main content

2. **Card Slider**
   - Horizontal row of technique cards
   - Each card includes:
     - Technique name (e.g., "Sensory grounding")
     - Brief description (1-2 lines)
     - Visual icon or indicator
   - Scroll indicators (partial cards visible at edges)
   - Smooth dragging experience

3. **Card Details**
   - Expanded view when card is selected
   - Full technique description
   - Step-by-step instructions
   - Visual elements to support technique
   - Clear close button

### Success Metrics
- Usage frequency of emergency help features
- Time spent engaging with techniques
- User feedback on helpfulness
- Drop-off points in interaction flow
- Performance metrics during high-stress interactions

This design approach will create a reassuring emergency help interface that is immediately accessible and provides valuable support techniques when users need them most.
