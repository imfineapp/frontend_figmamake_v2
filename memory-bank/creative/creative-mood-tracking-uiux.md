## 4Ô∏è‚É£ DECISION

**Selected Approach: Option A - Vertical Slider with Emotional States**

**Justification:**
This approach leverages the existing MoodSlider component while enhancing it with improved visual design and integration with the mood history graph. The vertical orientation works well on mobile devices and provides a natural mapping from "low" (bottom) to "high" (top) mood states. The emotional state labels provide clear context for users, and the integration with the graph creates a cohesive experience that shows both current mood and historical trends.

**Key Design Elements:**
- Vertical slider with 5 distinct positions
- Clear emotional state labels for each position
- Large, readable display of current mood
- Integrated 7-day comparison graph
- Simple "Submit" button for check-in
- Visual feedback for successful submission

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES

### Visual Design
- Use the app's primary color palette (#007AFF blue for active states)
- Implement a gradient background that shifts from cool to warm colors
- Use large, readable typography for mood labels (17px body, 22px headings)
- Ensure sufficient contrast for accessibility
- Add subtle animations for state transitions

### Interaction Design
- Tap or drag to select mood position
- Visual highlight of selected position
- Immediate feedback when mood is selected
- Smooth transition when submitting check-in
- Clear indication of successful submission

### Technical Considerations
- Extend the existing MoodSlider component
- Integrate with Recharts for the mood history graph
- Implement proper state management for mood selection
- Ensure responsive design for various screen sizes
- Optimize graph performance for mobile devices

### Content Structure
1. **Mood Slider Section**
   - Large heading: "How are you feeling today?"
   - Vertical slider with 5 positions
   - Emotional state labels: Sad, Anxious, Neutral, Energetic, Happy
   - Current selection display with larger text
   - Visual indicator matching emotional state

2. **Mood History Section**
   - Subheading: "Your mood this week"
   - 7-day comparison bar chart
   - Day labels (Mon, Tue, etc.)
   - Visual comparison with previous week
   - Trend indicator (up/down/neutral arrow)

3. **Action Section**
   - Primary "Submit" button
   - Secondary "Skip for now" option (if allowed by requirements)
   - Encouraging message after successful submission

### Success Metrics
- Daily check-in completion rate
- Time to complete mood check-in (<10 seconds target)
- User feedback on ease of use
- Mood data consistency over time
- Graph engagement metrics

This design approach will create a seamless daily check-in experience that encourages regular use while providing valuable insights to users about their emotional patterns.
