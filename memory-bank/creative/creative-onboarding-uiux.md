## 4️⃣ DECISION

**Selected Approach: Option A - Illustration-Heavy Onboarding**

**Justification:**
This approach best aligns with the mental wellness theme of the app and provides a visually distinctive experience that sets Menhausen apart. The large SVG illustrations will create an immersive, calming environment that supports the mental health focus. This approach also aligns with the existing design patterns seen in the imported Figma components.

**Key Design Elements:**
- Full-screen SVG background illustrations for each step
- Clear, concise value propositions with minimal text
- Prominent "Next" button with primary styling
- Progress dots at the bottom to indicate position in flow
- Smooth transitions between steps

## 5️⃣ IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES

### Visual Design
- Use the app's primary color palette (#007AFF blue as accent)
- Maintain 16px padding on all sides for mobile optimization
- Ensure illustrations are optimized for performance
- Use semi-bold typography for headings (22px)
- Use regular body text (17px) for descriptions

### Interaction Design
- Linear progression with no back navigation
- Progress dots showing current position
- Clear visual feedback on button hover/tap
- Smooth slide transitions between steps
- Final step leads directly to the main app

### Technical Considerations
- Import SVG illustrations as React components
- Ensure proper accessibility attributes
- Optimize for touch targets (minimum 44px)
- Implement responsive design for various screen sizes
- Preload illustrations for smoother transitions

### Content Structure
1. **Welcome Step**
   - Illustration: Person with thought bubble or brain icon
   - Heading: "Welcome to Menhausen"
   - Description: "Your personal mental wellness companion designed for men. Track your mood, access emergency techniques, and find support when you need it most."
   - Button: "Get Started"

2. **Value Proposition Step**
   - Illustration: Mood tracking interface or emotional spectrum
   - Heading: "Understand Your Mental State"
   - Description: "Daily check-ins help you track your emotional patterns and identify triggers. Our insights help you develop healthier habits and coping mechanisms."
   - Button: "Continue"

3. **Privacy Step**
   - Illustration: Lock icon or shield with checkmark
   - Heading: "Your Privacy Matters"
   - Description: "All your data is encrypted and stored securely. We never share your information with third parties. You're in control of your mental wellness journey."
   - Button: "Begin My Journey"

### Success Metrics
- Onboarding completion rate (>70% target)
- Time to complete onboarding (<60 seconds target)
- User feedback on clarity of value proposition
- Drop-off points analysis for optimization

This design approach will create a strong first impression that aligns with the app's mental wellness focus while providing clear value propositions to encourage continued engagement.
